# Pyhton-Exercices
Python was the first programming language that i have been study. Well, was html but that isnt a programming language. 
After i have realised that i searched for "Linguagens de programação para iniciantes" and the one that i have found was Python.
At that time my english wasnt very good and i always search on portuguese.
I've found on youtube for a playlist and found that "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9uPNppGsGo&list=PLvE-ZAFRgX8hnECDn1v9HNTI71veL3oW0&index=2".
That was my fisrt contact with python. At that precise moment i still seeing that playlist, not because my english still bad but because i started and i will finish.
In this repository i will post some exercices that i have done to study python.
