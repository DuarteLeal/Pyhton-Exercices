# Pyhton-Exercices
Python was the first programming language that I have been study (Well, was html but that isnt a programming language.) 

After I have realised that I searched for "Linguagens de programação para iniciantes" and the one that I have found was Python. At that time my english wasnt very good and I always search on portuguese.

I've found on youtube for a playlist and found that "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9uPNppGsGo&list=PLvE-ZAFRgX8hnECDn1v9HNTI71veL3oW0&index=2". That was my first contact with python. At that precise moment I still seeing that playlist, not because my english still bad but because I started and I will finish it, if u look, the time that I will update this repository with new exercices isnt regular because at this moment I am taking a course "Management and programming of computer systems" and now I am studying other language (C# (I will create a repository with C# exercices and projects) 

And in this repository I will post some exercices that I have done to study python.
