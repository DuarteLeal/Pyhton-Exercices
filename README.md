# Pyhton-Exercices
Python was the first programming language I studied. (Well, it was html but this is not a programming language)


After I realized this I researched for "Beginner programming language" and one of the ones I found was Pyhton. At that time my English was not very good so I was always researching in Portuguese


I searched on youtube for a playlist and found this one (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9uPNppGsGo&list=PLvE-ZAFRgX8hnECDn1v9HNTI71veL3oW0), this was my first contact with python. And at this moment I keep seeing this playlist, not because my English is bad but because I started and will finish it. If you notice, the times I'm going to update this ropsitory won't be regular because at this moment I'm doing a course "Management and programming of computer systems" and studying another programming language (C# (I'll create a repository for exercises and another one for projects I do))


And in this repository I will post some exercices that I have done to study python.
